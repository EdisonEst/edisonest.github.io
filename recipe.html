        <h1>Crispy Fried Chicken</h1>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <img src="media/chicken.webp" alt="Crispy Chicken" width="300" height="300" style="float:right;">
        <p>With all the prep work, fried chicken was by definition <em>special-occasion</em>food,
             and for most <b>African Americans</b>, <em>special occasions</em> were communal meals 
            connected to their church. Today, fried chicken is less about church and 
             more about <u>family</u>.

            The Sacred Roots of Fried Chicken

        <h3>Recipe </h3>
        <p>This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? 
             It combines all the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest,
             most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time.
       </p>
       <h4>Ingredients</h4>
       <ul>
            <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
       </ul>
       <h4>Steps to Make</h4>
       <ol>
            <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
            <li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use).
                <br> Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).</li>
            <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag
                 <br> and shake to coat well.</li>
            <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper.</li>
            <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</li>
            <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.</li> 
            <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through
                <br> but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</li>   
            <li>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have 
                <br>to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>
        </ol>
